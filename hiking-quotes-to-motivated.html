<h2>Best Hiking Quotes with Friends</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Speed is not a priority, just enjoy your hike – Keep smile. – Barry Perdana Putra</p>

<p>Returning home is the most difficult part of long-distance hiking; You have grown outside the puzzle and your piece no longer fits. – Cindy Ross</p>
<p>I love going out of my way, beyond what I know, and finding my way back a few extra miles, by another trail, with a compass that argues with the map…nights alone in motels in remote western towns where I know no one and no one I know knows where I am, nights with strange paintings and floral spreads and cable television that furnish a reprieve from my own biography, when in Benjamin’s terms, I have lost myself though I know where I am. Moments when I say to myself as feet or car clear a crest or round a bend, I have never seen this place before. Times when some architectural detail on vista that has escaped me these many years says to me that I never did know where I was, even when I was home. – Rebecca Solnit</p>
<p>Getting to the top is optional. Getting down is mandatory. – Ed Viesturs</p>
<p>None of your knowledge, your reading, your connections will be of any use here: two legs suffice, and big eyes to see with. Walk alone, across mountains or through forests. You are nobody to the hills or the thick boughs heavy with greenery. You are no longer a role, or a status, not even an individual, but a body, a body that feels sharp stones on the paths, the caress of long grass and the freshness of the wind. When you walk, the world has neither present nor future: nothing but the cycle of mornings and evenings. Always the same thing to do all day: walk. But the walker who marvels while walking (the blue of the rocks in a July evening light, the silvery green of olive leaves at noon, the violet morning hills) has no past, no plans, no experience. He has within him the eternal child. While walking I am but a simple gaze. – Frédéric Gros</p>
<p>You need mountains, long staircases don’t make good hikers. – Amit Kalantri</p>
<p>Hiking—much like drinking—is something that sounds more fun to the uninitiated than it actually is. – Mindy McGinnis</p>
<p>I love writing in the sunshine ’till my head throbs and hiking in the woods ’till my feet hurt. – Kaylee Stepkoski</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves. – Sir Edmund Hillary</p>
<p>Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step. – Lao Tzu</p>
</blockquote>
